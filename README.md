Android Google Play Billing Demo

Google Play Billing is a service provided by Google Play that lets you sell digital content from inside an Android app or “in-app.” This document describes the fundamental building blocks of a Google Play Billing solution. 

Google Play Billing can be used to sell two types of in-app products:

One-time products: an in-app product requiring a single, non-recurring charge to the user's form of payment. Additional game levels, premium loot boxes, or media files, are examples of one-time products. The Google Play Console refers to one-time products as "managed products", and the Google Play Billing library specifies one-time products as "INAPP".
Subscriptions: An in-app product requiring a recurring charge to the user's form of payment. Online magazines or music streaming services are examples of subscriptions.

Step 1 : Add this in gradle...

dependencies {
    ...
    implementation 'com.android.billingclient:billing:1.1'
}

Step 2 : Create an instance of BillingClient

// create new Person
private BillingClient mBillingClient;
...
mBillingClient = BillingClient.newBuilder(mActivity).setListener(this).build();
mBillingClient.startConnection(new BillingClientStateListener() {
    @Override
    public void onBillingSetupFinished(@BillingResponse int billingResponseCode) {
        if (billingResponseCode == BillingResponse.OK) {
            // The billing client is ready. You can query purchases here.
        }
    }
    @Override
    public void onBillingServiceDisconnected() {
        // Try to restart the connection on the next request to
        // Google Play by calling the startConnection() method.
    }
});

Step 3 : Implement PurchasesUpdatedListener's onPurchasesUpdated() method to receive updates on purchases initiated by your app, as well as those initiated by the Google Play Store.

Step 4 : To start a purchase request from your app, call the launchBillingFlow() method from the UI thread.
    Pass a reference to a BillingFlowParams object containing the relevant data to complete the purchase, such as the product ID (skuId) of the item and product type (SkuType.INAPP for a one-time product or SkuType.SUBS for a subscription).

When you call the launchBillingFlow() method, the system displays the Google Play purchase screen.

Step 5 : To query Google Play for in-app product details, call the querySkuDetailsAsync() method.

When calling this method, pass an instance of SkuDetailsParams that specifies a list of products ID strings and a SkuType. The SkuType can be either SkuType.INAPP for one-time products, or SkuType.SUBS, for subscriptions.
    
Query most recent purchases 

The queryPurchases() method uses a cache of the Google Play Store app without initiating a network request.

If you need to check the most recent purchase made by the user for each product ID, you can use the queryPurchaseHistoryAsync() method.

queryPurchaseHistoryAsync() returns the most recent purchase made by the user for each product ID, even if that purchase is expired, cancelled, or consumed.

Step 6 : Verify purchases
